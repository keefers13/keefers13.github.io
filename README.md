Pizza Menu<br>
This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the
input information and caluclates a price for the order.
<hr>
Tic-Tac-Toe Game<br>
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first
and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants
to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

Calculator<br>
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version
of a calculator.
